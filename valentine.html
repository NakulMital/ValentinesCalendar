                        "My Darling Baby,<br><br>
                        I just want to start by saying that I love you so so so much. I want you to know that this is
                        not just one day that I want to show my love for you but everyday that I am able to spend with
                        you. I cannot ever believe that I get to call someone like you as my girlfriend. Every second
                        since the time that I fell for you, I have just keep thanking God for bringing you into my life.
                        From the moment you have walked in my life, my life has only improved and become soo much
                        better. <br><br>
                        I cannot thank you for the love and support you have constantly given me, and thank you for
                        always motivating me to do better in life and my academics. Everything that I do, all the
                        stress, late nights, anxiety I go through to get through Rose and every challenge that comes my
                        way just so that I can give you the life that you deserve. You have been nothing but the most
                        perfect girlfriend and have been the most genuine person I have ever met with a heart that just
                        wants to keep giving. Adonia you are the kind of person I would only meet once in my life, and
                        that, along with infinite more reasons, is why you deserve more than you can ever dream of.
                        <br><br>
                        Adonia your energy is special, it is something that everyone in the world should cherish and
                        treasure. It shows in the way that when animals stare at you, people get inspired by you, and
                        kids look up to you. You are a testament to what good energy and hope look like. You have made
                        such a large impact on my life, I have learnt, and still am learning, how to see the world from
                        a better view, a view that promotes love and not hate, and has made me reflect a lot and made me
                        change in soo many ways for the better. Thank you for being patient with me as I continue to
                        learn and grow through the knowledge and wisdom that you give me.
                        <br><br>
                        I know that things between us are not the best right now and I would not want anything more than
                        to have these things get fixed. This is the first time that we are going through something like
                        this and I am going through a range of emotions. I do truly believe that we will get through
                        this because a love like ours is rare. I dont want to even imagine spending my life with anyone
                        other than you because I know you are my soulmate and the only person on this planet for me. I
                        know God brought us close together for a reason and everytime I think of that, I get more hope
                        in us and the fact that I want to cherish every single second I get to spend with you, which I
                        already do right now. I want to let you know that I am taking steps and doing things that help
                        me be a better boyfriend and a person in general. I already am going to counseling and wont stop
                        and figure out how to be better and make sure our love stays forever and ever. I have already
                        told people that I will marry you and be with you forever Adonia. I have already looked at
                        pictures of you and seen if I will cry when I see you for the first time at our wedding, and I
                        am happy to report that I have in fact, cried everytime I have thought of that. I cannot imagine
                        a life with you to be anything but the most perfect, love-filled life ever.
                        <br><br>
                        "I love you. I've loved you from the moment we played table tennis together. I've loved you at
                        every lunch, on every walk, every time we've been together, and every time we've been apart. (I
                        dont agree with this but it fits the dialogue but) You do not have to accept it or embrace it or
                        even allow it. Knowing you, you probably will not. But you must know it, in your heart. You must
                        feel it because I do. I love you. I want a life that suits us both. I know I am imperfect, but I
                        will humble myself before you, because I cannot imagine my life without you, and that is why I
                        wish to marry you." Even though this was said by the guy who would always do better in
                        situations than me, I want you to know that you are the boon of my existence and nothing Anthony
                        can do will ever come close to the amount that I love you and that he can never love you nearly
                        as much as I do. There is not a corner on this earth where I wont love you, I dont care if the
                        distance between us 20 minutes or 30 hours, my heart always did, does, and will always beat for
                        you and you only, and even so far away, I know one thing for sure, and that is that I always
                        want to be with the most perfect person, my favorite, my everything... Adonia.
                        <br><br>
                        I want to be yours forever, marry you, and spend the rest of my life giving you the love you
                        deserve. Happy valentines day my love.
                        <br><br>
                        I love you more than words can express.<br><br>
                        Forever yours,<br>
                        Nakul"
