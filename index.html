                    "My Baby,<br><br>
                    I just wanted to let you know that you are my everything and I can't wait to spend the rest of my
                    life
                    with you. I cannot wait to travel the world with you and make memories that will be with me forever.
                    I cannot wait for the day I marry you and am able to be yours forever cause that is all I ever want.
                    You make every day easier and give me the strength to be able to combat anything and everything that
                    comes my way.
                    <br><br>
                    I just wanted to let you know that I am so proud of how far you have come as a person and as a
                    girlfriend. You have been nothing but the most perfect girlfriend ever and I cannot believe I am
                    with someone like you. You are the most beautiful, intelligent, and kind-hearted person I know and I
                    am so lucky to have you in my life. I know the situation we have been put in with long distance is
                    difficult but I am so happy and proud of us for coming soo far and not looking like we are stopping
                    anytime soon! I cannot wait to see you again and hug you and kiss you and never let you go.
                    <br><br>
                    I still remember the feeling I had in my heart when I had a crush on you. I was so happy to leave a
                    dark part of my life and move into something so special with the most special person ever. You are
                    soo hot, like oh my God you are hot. You are genuinely the hottest person ever and I cannot believe
                    I am with a baddie like you. I genuinely believe you are the epitome of beauty, the bar-setter for
                    love, and proof of what a good God the world has that he blessed the world with you.
                    <br><br>
                    I want you to know I am so so in love with you and want you to know that I will always be there for
                    you no matter what. I want to spend the rest of my life with my hand in yours. I love us and I
                    always will for the rest of my life. I dont ever want us to end. My heart has, is, and will always
                    continue beating for you.
                    <br><br>
                    Love,<br>
                    Nakul"
